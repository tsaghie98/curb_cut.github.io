			New York, NY-A driveway into your house is the epitome of luxury for suburban New York City. They relieve drivers from the time consuming task of finding parking, while contributing to the deficiency in parking spots for everyone else. While many people want the driveways, the permitting process can be tedious and expensive, leading many New Yorkers to pursue them illegally. A 2021 audit from at the time Comptroller Scott Stringer found that illegal curb cutting was a widespread practice, and that the Department of Buildings was negligent in investigating complaints, issuing violations, and granting permits.
		</p>
		<p class="second-p">
			Curb cutting is the practice of converting the sidewalk in front of one’s house into a driveway by building a ramp where the sidewalk would have been elevated and flat. This allows people to drive their cars to parking spots next to their house, while creating the false impression that it would be illegal to park in front. In order to build them, homeowners are required to obtain a permit from the Department of Buildings.

		<p class="third-p">
			Updated data shows that this issue is still prevalent, but not one that equally affects all parts of the city. In fact, the vast majority of cases are in Brooklyn, accounting for 526 out of the 551 violations specifically issued for illegal curb cuts since 1988. When viewed on a map, one can see that the majority of those violations are in South Brooklyn, a part of the city where a large number of people drive and population density is  relatively high.
		</p>
		<p class="fourth-p">
			The map is based on data  from the Department of Buildings that documents all violations they have issued since 1988, available on NYC Open Data. The findings are staggering, revealing only one violation to have ever been issued in the Bronx, fewer than have been issued in any individual neighborhood in Brooklyn. The findings are indicative of several possible issues.
		</p>
		<p class="fifth-p">
			The analysis could be evidence that violations are not being issued equitably, that they are not being documented properly, or that the problem simply does not exist equally across the city. Stringer’s 2021 audit found that inspectors were not properly documenting illegal curb cuts, leading to many cases being dismissed, which this dataset omitted.
		</p>
		<p class="sixth-p">
			Additionally, this data could be an indication that permits are being issued more freely in other boroughs, eliminating the need to install them illegally. Stringer’s audit also found that the Department of Buildings was improperly issuing permits when all of the conditions for construction were not met, allowing owners to illegally cut curbs.
		</p>
		<p class="seventh-p">
			Regardless, the sheer scale of the discrepancy indicates that something unique is occurring in South Brooklyn that is resulting in the disproportionate issuing of violations. Curb cutting, an act of illegally seizing public property, affects all New Yorkers, especially drivers who complain about the lack of parking spots. They can be reported to the city through 311's online portal.
